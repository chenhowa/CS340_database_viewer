# Project Style 1
## Pure Javascript, built-in data structures, functional-style, libraries, MySQL Server
After examining the options provided by built-in JavaScript, I've concluded that some libraries are necessary to write robust code. While I wanted to be minimalist with the libraries and modules I use, my research suggests that it's hard to be concise and expressive without using some libraries.

So in using these libraries, I'm loosely using the following criteria:
* They should simplify complex tasks that require micro-managing repetitive code and annoying syntax--especially tasks that aren't built into the standard (global?) namespace of Node or browser Javascript.
* They **shouldn't** simplify DOM manipulation -- part of the reason I'm working on this at all is that I did such a bad job of managing DOM object complexity in the original files. I want to see if I can do a better job. For that reason, I'm avoiding modules like jQuery, React, and Angular. All those options would be good to learn, and I might use them in a future iteration, but not this one.

I'm also willing to use any libraries that are standard for improving performance of the application.
