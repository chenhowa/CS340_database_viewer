 * Filename: controller.js
 * Author: Howard Chen
 * Description: Contains logic for attaching event handlers
 * 		to the DOM objects created in view.js. Also creates data
 * 		structures for organizing those DOM objects. Utilizes
 * 		imported functions that return DOM objects. Attempts to
 * 		avoid changing the state of existing objects, trying
 * 		to minimize side-effects through a more functional style
 * 		of programming.
